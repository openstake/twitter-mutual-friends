"Twitter mutual friends" is a set of tools (or perhaps simply documentation for API calls) that shows how to match up two users friends and see what the stream is of their overlapping feeds.

It's mostly experimental now (in the form of one liners and curl commands) awaiting some sense for how useful it is and how on earth to make it go a little faster.

the simplest version looks like this:

#!/bin/sh
curl http://twitter.com/friends/ids.xml'?'screen_name=$1 > $1.friends.xml
curl http://twitter.com/friends/ids.xml'?'screen_name=$2 > $2.friends.xml
grep -f $1.friends.xml $2.friends.xml > $1+$2.friends.xml

to generate a list of overlapping friends.
